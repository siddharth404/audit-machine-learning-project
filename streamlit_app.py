        This application allows you to interact with a question-answering chatbot. 
        You can enter a context or passage, and then ask questions about it.
        
        ### Features
        - **DistilBERT-based QA**: Uses the DistilBERT model to answer questions.
        - **Interactive Chat**: Engage in a conversation with the QA bot to get answers from a given context.
        
        ### Key Applications
        #### Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
        - **Speeding up KYC Analysis**: In AML, analysts often need to review large volumes of customer information and documents during the Know Your Customer (KYC) process. This QA tool can help quickly extract key information from these documents, speeding up the review and decision-making process.
        - **Identifying Red Flags**: QA models can assist in identifying specific patterns or red flags in customer behavior based on large datasets, allowing analysts to focus on high-risk cases.

        #### Digital Internal Audit
        - **Efficient Documentation Review**: Internal audits often require the review of extensive documentation, policies, and procedures. This QA tool can significantly reduce the time required to extract relevant information from these documents, ensuring that auditors can focus on analysis rather than manual document searches.
        - **Improved Audit Insights**: By asking targeted questions, auditors can use the QA tool to quickly gain insights into compliance issues, control weaknesses, and operational risks, allowing for more efficient and effective audits.

        ### How to Use
        1. Enter a context for the bot to understand.
        2. Type in your questions, and the bot will provide the answers.
